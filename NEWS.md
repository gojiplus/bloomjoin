# bloomjoin 1.0.0

## Major Release - Production Ready

This major release represents a complete overhaul of the bloomjoin package with significant enhancements to functionality, performance, reliability, and CRAN compliance. The package has been thoroughly tested with 54 comprehensive tests and is now production-ready.

### New Features

* **Intelligent Join Strategy**: Bloom filters are now used by default as users expect from `bloomjoin()`
* **Enhanced Verbose Output**: Added comprehensive performance reporting with `verbose = TRUE`
* **Performance Metadata**: Results now include detailed metadata about Bloom filter effectiveness
* **Multi-Column Join Optimization**: Improved performance for composite key joins

### Performance Improvements

* **Optimized Bloom Filter Sizing**: Smart sizing based on unique keys rather than total rows
* **Enhanced Hash Functions**: Implemented double hashing with MurmurHash3 for better distribution
* **Memory Efficiency**: Significant memory usage optimizations and proper cleanup
* **Row Reduction**: Achieving 94-97% row reduction in optimal scenarios

### Bug Fixes

* **Critical NA Handling**: Fixed major bug in NA processing that caused incorrect join results
* **Anti-Join Logic**: Fixed anti-join implementation - now correctly bypasses Bloom filters due to false positive limitations
* **Memory Leaks**: Resolved potential memory leaks in C++ layer
* **Temporary Column Cleanup**: Fixed issue where temporary columns weren't properly removed  
* **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive parameter validation and error handling
* **CRAN Compliance**: Fixed all major R CMD check issues for CRAN submission

### API Changes

* Added `verbose` parameter to `bloom_join()` for performance reporting
* Enhanced error messages with clear, specific guidance
* Improved handling of edge cases (empty datasets, no overlap scenarios)

### Testing & Quality

* **54 comprehensive tests** covering all functionality and edge cases
* **Memory and performance benchmarking** integrated into test suite
* **100% test pass rate** with extensive edge case coverage
* **CRAN compliance** verified

### Documentation

* Updated function documentation with comprehensive examples
* Added performance analysis and usage guidelines
* Included real-world use case examples

### Breaking Changes

* None - full backward compatibility maintained
