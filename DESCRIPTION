Description: Provides high-performance join operations for large data frames using
    Bloom filters to reduce memory usage and improve performance. The package is
    particularly effective when joining a large data frame with a smaller lookup table,
    and when many keys in the larger data frame don't have matches. Features include
    optimized C++ implementation, intelligent join strategy selection, comprehensive
    NA handling, and support for all standard join types.
