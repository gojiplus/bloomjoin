Package: bloomjoin
Title: Efficient Data Frame Joins Using Bloom Filters
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: person("Gaurav Sood", email = "gsood07@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides optimized join operations for large data frames using
    Bloom filters to reduce memory usage and improve performance. It is particularly
    effective when joining a large data frame with a smaller one, and when many keys
    in the larger data frame don't have matches.
