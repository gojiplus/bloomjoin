\title{BloomJoin: Efficient data.frame joins using Bloom filters}
\description{
A package that provides optimized join operations for large data frames using
Bloom filters to reduce memory usage and improve performance. The Bloom filter is
used to pre-filter rows that won't match in the final join operation, significantly
reducing the computational cost for large datasets with low overlap.
}
\details{
The main function in this package is \code{\link{bloom_join}}, which implements
various types of joins (inner, left, right, full, semi, anti) using Bloom filters
to improve performance. This is particularly useful for large datasets where the
join operation would otherwise be memory-intensive and slow.
