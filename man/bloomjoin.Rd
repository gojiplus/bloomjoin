\title{BloomJoin: Efficient data.frame joins using probabilistic prefilters}
\description{
\code{bloom_join()} wraps the standard dplyr join verbs with a probabilistic
pre-filter stage implemented in C++ via Rcpp. The filter trims the rows that
reach the expensive join when the overlap between the two tables is small,
yielding faster joins without changing the final result.
}
\details{
The exported surface mirrors the dplyr join verbs while adding controls for
the pre-filter:
\itemize{
\item \code{engine} selects the probabilistic data structure (currently only Bloom
filters are implemented).
\item \code{prefilter_side} decides which input will be filtered before calling the
underlying join.
\item \code{fpr} configures the target false positive rate for the Bloom filter.
\item \code{n_hint} allows callers to pass optional distinct-count hints for the join
keys which helps size the filter without extra scans.
}

The function automatically samples the key columns to estimate distinct
counts, chooses which side to pre-filter when \code{prefilter_side = "auto"}, and
falls back to the raw dplyr join when the Bloom filter would not remove enough
rows to pay for its construction.
